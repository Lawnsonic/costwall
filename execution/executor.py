"""
Two-legged hedge executor: fill-driven sizing and reconciliation.

Short the USD-M perp, buy the spot, at minimum size. This is a MECHANISM
TEST, not a trade. scanner.py refused the entire board; nothing here clears
cost. The point is to prove the execution path is real and to measure what
it actually costs, with every number coming off a live fill.

ARCHITECTURE, because it constrains everything below.

Orders go through the Binance MCP server, which is authenticated by OAuth in
the agent session. Python cannot call it: venue.py is unauthenticated public
REST and there are no API keys on disk. So this module does not place orders.
It does the arithmetic and holds the state; the agent places each order and
feeds the raw JSON response back in.

That costs something real, and the log says so instead of glossing it:
between leg one filling and leg two filling there is an agent round trip, and
for the length of it the position is one-sided and directionally exposed.
exposure_seconds in the report is that window, timed off the two fills.

THE ORDERING RULE (CONTEXT section 7.1) is the reason this is a state machine
and not one function. Leg one goes on first. Leg two is sized from the
ACTUAL filled quantity in leg one's response, truncated to spot's own step.
Never from the intended figure both were planned against. A market order can
fill short, and sizing leg two off the intention rather than the fill is how
you end up with a hedge that is not a hedge.

    python executor.py plan                     pick symbol, size leg 1
    python executor.py record-leg1  --response  read the fill, size leg 2
    python executor.py record-leg2  --response  reconcile, log residual
    python executor.py unwind                   leg 2 failed: shrink leg 1
    python executor.py close                    plan both closing orders
    python executor.py record-close --leg fut|spot --response
    python executor.py report                   full reconciliation
    python executor.py preflight                one unpaired futures order

--response takes a file path, a raw JSON string, or - for stdin.

    Found by the preflight order on 2026-09-04, which is why the preflight

    and cumQty but NO avgPrice and NO cumQuote, even with
