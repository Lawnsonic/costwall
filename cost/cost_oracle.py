"""
The cost engine, separated from the scanner so a tool call can reach it.

scanner.py prices a trade against a constant. This prices it against the book
that exists at the moment of the call, at the size actually being traded, and
returns a decision object with the workings attached.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A CONSTANT
--------------------------------------
The paired run of 2026-09-05 06:33 UTC is the argument. The executor measured
a 13.55 bps entry basis at plan time, carried 19.32 bps in the constant, and
paid 30.50 bps on the fill, all inside one minute. A constant is the wrong
shape for a quantity that moves that fast. The only honest way to know it is
to measure it at the moment of trading.

THE PRICING MODEL, AND WHY THE OLD ONE WAS WRONG
------------------------------------------------
The executor predicted the price cost of a round trip as the two spreads it
crosses, 6.77 bps. Realised was 30.50. That is not a calibration error, it is
the wrong model, and the fills say so:

    open    spot BUY  0.02962      perp SELL 0.02953     basis +30.43 bps
    close   spot SELL 0.02954      perp BUY  0.02954     basis   0.00 bps
                                                         ----------------
    entry basis + exit basis                                   30.43 bps
    realised price term, from the reconciliation                30.50 bps

So the round trip costs the basis you enter at plus the basis you exit at,
not the spreads. The two models only agree when the basis at the close equals
the basis at the open. It did not: the venues were 9 ticks apart going in and
level coming out.

That has a consequence worth stating, because it is the whole reason a hedge
can be sized correctly and still lose. Opening a delta-neutral hedge into a
wide positive basis means being long the expensive venue and short the cheap
one. If the dislocation persists you give the basis back on the exit and pay
only spreads. If it converges you eat all of it. Convergence is the direction
a basis tends to move, so the conservative assumption is that it reverts, and
this module prices it that way:

    price cost = entry basis (measured now, at size, floored at zero)
               + exit spread (both venues, half each, at a basis of zero)

Erring conservative can only make the oracle refuse more. It can never
manufacture a trade. That is the same rule scanner.py already follows, and it
is why the entry basis is floored: a basis that happens to point the right way
is reported in evidence but not banked as a discount, because a dislocation
can widen as easily as it reverts and a favourable one must never be allowed
to argue a trade into existence.

EVERYTHING IS MEASURED AT SIZE
------------------------------
Top of book is not a price for an order, it is a price for the first slice of
one. Every figure below walks the actual depth ladder for the actual quantity
and returns the VWAP, so a thin book shows up as a worse price rather than as
a footnote. The gap between the top-of-book number and the at-size number is
reported separately as depth impact.

Public REST only. No auth, no keys, no MCP. This module reads books and does
arithmetic; it cannot place an order and holds no credentials.
