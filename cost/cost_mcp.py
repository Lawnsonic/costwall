costcheck: an MCP server that prices a proposed trade before it is placed.

    python cost_mcp.py

Launched by the client over stdio. Registration is a command and an args
pair in whatever config file the client reads; see the MCP server section
of the README. Nothing here is specific to one agent harness.

One tool, stdio transport, no port, no OAuth, no credentials. It reads public
order books and does arithmetic. It cannot place an order, cannot move funds,
and holds no keys, so the worst a compromised copy of it can do is quote you
a bad number, which is also the reason it is safe to leave connected.

WHAT IT IS FOR
--------------
An agent connected to Binance Agent OS can place real orders. It reasons in
sentences, and the loss lives in basis points. This gives it the number.

The tool returns a decision object rather than prose, because prose is the
failure mode: a paragraph explaining that a trade is expensive is something a
model can talk itself past, whereas `"decision": "REJECT", "shortfall_bps":
30.29` is not. The arithmetic arrives in the context as a value, not as
something the model was supposed to remember or derive.

WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------
It is not a security boundary, and pretending otherwise would be the most
dangerous claim in this repository. The agent still holds `spot_newOrder`. It
can call this tool, read REJECT, and place the order anyway; nothing here can
stop it. This is an advisory layer enforced by policy, and the policy is a
line in CLAUDE.md that a model can ignore.

Making it non-bypassable means the agent never holding the raw order tool at
all: it calls a gateway, the gateway prices the trade, and only the gateway
can reach Binance. That is a different piece of software from this one and it
is not built here. What is built here is the arithmetic such a gateway would
have to run, which is the part that has to be right first.

WHY EVERY FAILURE RETURNS A REFUSAL
-----------------------------------
An exception reaching the agent is worse than useless, because a model that
asked for a cost and got an error will often shrug and continue. So every
path out of this file is a decision object, and every path that could not
finish the arithmetic is a REJECT. Fail closed. The one thing this tool must
never do is stay silent and let the order through.
