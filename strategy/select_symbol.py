"""
Symbol selection for the mechanism test.

This does NOT pick a symbol by funding rate. scanner.py already established
that nothing on the board clears its cost-to-beat, so there is no funding
trade to take. What this picks is the symbol on which a two-legged hedge at
minimum size is least wrong. The threshold itself lives in scanner.py and is
deliberately not repeated here.

The problem it solves: spot and USD-M futures publish different lot filters
for the same asset. A hedge is opened on the futures leg, and the spot leg
is then truncated to the spot stepSize against the actual futures fill. The
difference is unhedged delta you are holding whether you meant to or not.

What the live board actually says: only 6 of 356 hedgeable pairs have a spot
step COARSER than their futures step, so for almost every symbol that
truncation is exactly zero. ACEUSDT is the real case, a 0.01 futures step
against a 0.1 spot step, so up to one full spot step, 0.1 ACE or roughly 36
bps of a $5 leg, can end up unhedged depending on where the futures quantity
lands. At this size truncation is not the dominant error.

What dominates is the cross-venue entry basis, typically 15-25 bps, paid the
instant both legs are on. That is the FRICTION constant in scanner.py.

The spot fee was the other suspect, on the theory that a BUY pays commission
in the base asset and so lands short. A live check on 2026-09-04 disproved
it for this account: commission settles in BNB at 7.5 bps, the base quantity
arrives intact, and the fee residual is zero. See venue.py for the calls.

So for every symbol listed on both venues this computes, from live filters
and live top-of-book:

  min_leg        smallest per-leg notional that satisfies BOTH venues
  fut_qty        what the futures leg would actually fill at
  spot_qty       fut_qty truncated to the spot step
  step_resid     fut_qty - spot_qty, the unhedged remainder, in base and USD
  worst_step     one spot lot step as bps of the leg, the bound on that
                 remainder at this size regardless of where price ticks
  fee_resid      zero on this account. Verified 2026-09-04: spot commission
                 settles in BNB, so a BUY delivers the full base quantity.
                 Reverts to the taker rate out of base if burn is off.
  spread         measured, both venues, both sides. Replaces the assumed
                 5 bps friction constant with a number from the book.

Ranked by the truncation bound (rounded up to whole bps, since a
sub-cent residual is noise), then by measured round-trip spread.
